Hello! 😁 My Name is Catherine Paris. 

I'm a Global Affairs major at the University of Notre Dame. I have minors in 1) Computing and Digital Technology Studies, 2) Foundations of Business, 3) Gender Studies. I am set to graduate in May 2027. I am originally from Summit, New Jersey but actually live abroad in London now! In my free time, I enjoy scrapbooking, watching ice hockey (go rangers!), and spending time with my friends :)

- Current Projects:🌱 I’m currently learning Python through platforms like Google Colab and VS Code.
- Skills 💻: I'm comfortable working on data visualization projects and using libraries like Seaborn to create clear, informative visual representations of data.

- Goals 😄:  I'm looking forward to better understanding GitHub and all its features!
